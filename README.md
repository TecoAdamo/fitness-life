Application to control how many calories the user is consuming on a daily basis.
The application involves the user entering their food or drink into the input and adding the amount of kcal.

At the top of the application, a calendar model was added, the Calendar Strip was used where it remains updated depending on the day the user is using the application.
The application will still be undergoing changes, I will still be seeing new features to be created and uploaded so that the application will have an increasingly robust performance.
